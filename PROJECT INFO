In this project, I worked on transforming a large operational database into a Data Warehouse to support analytics and decision-making.

🔹 I started by designing an analytical data model (Star Schema) that included:

Dimension tables such as: Dim_Customer, Dim_Product, Dim_Date, Dim_SalesTerritory

And a Fact table: Fact_Sales for connecting and analyzing sales data

🔹 I used SSIS to transfer data from the original OLTP database to the new Data Warehouse through a complete ETL process, making sure to:

Clean the data

Transform it appropriately

And load it efficiently into the new tables

📌 One of my main tasks was creating the Dim_Customer table.

🛠️ Tools used:

Microsoft SQL Server

SSIS

T-SQL

Star Schema Modeling

💡 This project enhanced my experience in data analysis, especially in designing analytical databases and implementing ETL processes in a practical way.
